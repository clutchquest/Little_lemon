WEBSITE FOR LITTLE LEMON REVIEW AND IDENTIFICATION LIST:

There a six sections of the website: Nav bar, Hero section, Special Highlights, Testimonials, About section, Footer Nav.
The basic layout is already set, but the finer details need to be refined or overhauled.

About two of the six sections need to be redone (Special Highlights, and Testimonials). while the rest need to be added with more detail and design.

Special Highlights should be in a zigzag layout that has each of the dishes fade in while sliding inward while scrolling.(Also need a Menu of a few regular dishes that arent in the "spotlight")

Testimonial section needs to be made, about four should do with two testimonials on top of each other side by side in a collum like struture.

The About Section needs to be made, needs a description of Mario and Adrian(Owners) and a couple of Pictures .


The footer need to have contact information(fake information, not real information.) along with links that refered back to the previous sections of the Homepage.

two pages that needed to be added are the Menu and booking page.(Menu needs to be italian quazine)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top Nav bar shows Little lemon logo to the top left of the page. from the middle towards the right there are Top links that coordinate to certain pages or the sections in the Homepage.


Below the Nav bar shows the Hero section where a picture resides to the right of a short introductory with the Brand name and city location on top.


The Specials section comes next along with a link to the menu."Under the Lime light" showcases the Specials for this week. the design will have a zigzag pattern downward, revealing the dishes as they slide inward with a fade-in.

Testimonials are about four of the best reviews of the restaraunt, including a name, the picture of the reviewer, the review rating, and a small description of the persons thoughts. The desgin is four squares encasing the individual testimonials that are stacked in a two by two formation.

The about section is a small paragragh of the owners history, and why they created the restaraunt in the first place. to the right of the paragragh is a couple of pictures layred atop each other.

last the footer has the little lemon logo to the far left while a navigation and contact info are spanned from left to right. A copyright stamp is placed at the far right of the footer.

Booking page will be a popup window that you can fill out the Date time and number of people for a reservation. along with your first and last name with email to contact you.

The Menu shows some of the italian dishes little lemon has to offer with pricing, a short description. and a picture of the dish. it will be in between the Specials and the testimonials.
